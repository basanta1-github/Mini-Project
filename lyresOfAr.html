            The Lyres of Ur or Harps of Ur is a group of four string instruments excavated in a fragmentary condition at
            the Royal Cemetery at Ur in modern Iraq from 1922 onwards. They date back to the Early Dynastic III Period
            of Mesopotamia, between about 2550 and 2450 BC, making them the world's oldest surviving stringed
            instruments. Carefully restored and reconstructed, they are now divided between museums in Iraq, the
            United Kingdom , and the United States.

            Strictly speaking, three lyres and one harp were unearthed, but all are often called lyres. The instrument
            remains were restored and distributed between the museums that took part in the excavations. The "Golden
            Lyre of Ur" or "Bull's Lyre", the finest, is in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. The British Museum in London has
            the "Queen's Lyre" and "Silver Lyre", and the Penn Museum in Philadelphia has the "Bull-Headed Lyre".

            In 1929, archaeologists led by the British archaeologist Leonard Woolley, representing a joint expedition of
            the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, found the
            instruments while excavating the Royal Cemetery at Ur. They excavated pieces of three lyres and one harp in
            Ur, located in what was Ancient Mesopotamia and is contemporary Iraq. They are over 4,500 years
            old, from ancient Mesopotamia during the Early Dynastic III Period (2550â€“2450 BC). The decorations on
            the lyres are fine examples of the court art of Mesopotamia of the period.
