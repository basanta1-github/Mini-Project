            The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family.
            Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in
            the family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings (some can have five), usually tuned in
            perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings.
            It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by
            striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).

            Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the
            Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments.
            Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in
            jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and
            jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin
            has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music.
            The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it.

            The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and
            19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as the
            basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the
            viola.
