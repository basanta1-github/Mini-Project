            The ney (Persian: Ney/نی, Arabic: Al-Nāy/الناي), is an end-blown flute that figures prominently in Persian
            music, Turkish music and Arabic music. In some of these musical traditions, it is the only wind instrument
            used. The ney has been played continually for 4,500–5,000 years in ancient Egypt, making it one of the
            oldest musical instruments still in use.

            The Egyptian ney consists of a hollow cylinder with finger-holes. Sometimes a brass, horn, or plastic
            mouthpiece is placed at the top to protect the wood from damage, and to provide a sharper and more durable
            edge to blow on. The ney consists of a piece of hollow cane or giant reed with five or six finger holes and
            one thumb hole. Modern neys may instead be made of metal or plastic tubing. The pitch of the ney varies
            depending on the region and the finger arrangement. A highly skilled ney player, called neyzen, can reach
            more than three octaves, though it is more common to have several "helper" neys to cover different pitch
            ranges or to facilitate playing technically difficult passages in other dastgahs or maqams.

            In Romanian, this instrument is called "fluier", the word nai is applied to a curved pan flute while an
            end-blown flute resembling the Persian ney is referred to as caval.
